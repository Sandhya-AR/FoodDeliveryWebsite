# Sezzato 🍕 – Full Stack Food Delivery App

Sezzato is a feature-rich food delivery web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes secure user authentication, cart management, order tracking, admin inventory control, and integrated Stripe payments – all wrapped in a clean and intuitive UI.

> PS: Food prices might be unreasonably high… I'm the dev and the imaginary restaurant owner, gotta secure the virtual bag! 💰😂
